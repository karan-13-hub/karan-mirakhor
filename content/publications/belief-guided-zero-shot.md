We propose a novel approach to zero-shot coordination in multi-agent systems by leveraging belief modeling and opponent adaptation. Our method enables agents to coordinate effectively with unseen partners by maintaining beliefs about their strategies and adapting accordingly. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in cooperative environments with partial observability.
