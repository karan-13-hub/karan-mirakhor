We present a hierarchical approach to task planning for robotic object rearrangement in partially observable environments. The method combines high-level symbolic planning with low-level motion planning, enabling robots to handle uncertainty and adapt to changing environments. Experimental results show improved success rates in cluttered indoor scenarios.
