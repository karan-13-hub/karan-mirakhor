## About Me

Hello! I‚Äôm Karan Mirakhor, a second-year Master of Science (Research) student in Robotics (MSR) at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
Graduate Research Assistant - [Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/advanced-agent-robotics-technology-lab/)
Advisor: [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/)    
My research primarily focuses on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Specifically, my work is on:

---

üß† Zero-shot Coordination in Cooperative MARL  
Developing agents that can seamlessly collaborate with previously unseen partners without additional training.  
Specifically, I focus on offline-to-online training frameworks that leverage behavioral diversity in offline datasets and enable efficient online adaptation using belief models.

üé≠ Competitive MARL and Targeted Deception  
Developing targeted deception strategies by leveraging higher-order opponent belief models and analyzing historical response patterns to identify and exploit individual behavioral vulnerabilities.

## Previous Research Experience

üìö Pre-doctoral Research Fellow ‚Äî [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation)  
Advisor: [Dr. Brojeshwar Bhowmick](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=Eqf8NrEAAAAJ&hl=en)  

Explored Task Planning for Indoor Object Rearrangement under partial observability (POMDP). Developed scalable graph-based scene representations, utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic object search, and applied Deep RL for efficient single and multi-room planning.

üéì B.Tech (Honors) in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) ‚Äî [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)  
Research Assistant, [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/)  
Advisor: [Dr. Harikumar Kandath](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=5i1t_QgAAAAJ&hl=en)  

Worked on aerial manipulator control using Control Barrier Lyapunov constraints within a Model Predictive Controller for safe and stable operation.

## üî≠ Future Vision

I am fascinated by how intelligent agents can learn structured, transferable policies that generalize across tasks, embodiments, and environments, moving toward autonomous systems capable of learning and reasoning like humans.  

My long-term goal is to develop generalist robot policies that unify learning, reasoning, and control, advancing adaptable embodied agents for diverse real-world tasks.

## ‚òï Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I enjoy ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess, üè∏ Squash, and üèì Table Tennis tennis. I‚Äôm a dedicated ‚òï coffee enthusiast who enjoys strategy both on and off the board.
