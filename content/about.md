## About Me

Hello! I’m Karan Mirakhor, a second-year MSR student in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/).

My research lies at the intersection of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), belief modeling, and generalization in cooperative and competitive settings.  
At CMU’s [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), I work on:

### 🧠 Zero-shot Coordination in Cooperative MARL  
Developing agents that can seamlessly collaborate with previously unseen partners without additional training.  
Specifically, I focus on offline-to-online training frameworks that leverage behavioral diversity in offline datasets and enable efficient online adaptation using belief models.

### 🎭 Competitive MARL and Targeted Deception  
Developing targeted deception strategies by leveraging higher-order opponent belief models and analyzing historical response patterns to identify and exploit individual behavioral vulnerabilities.

## 🔭 Research Vision

I am fascinated by how intelligent agents can learn structured, transferable policies that generalize across tasks, embodiments, and environments, moving toward autonomous systems capable of learning and reasoning like humans.  

My long-term goal is to develop generalist robot policies that unify learning, reasoning, and control, advancing adaptable embodied agents for diverse real-world tasks.
