### About Me

Hello! I’m **Karan Mirakhor**, a **second-year Master’s (MSR) student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University**, advised by [**Prof. Katia Sycara**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/).

My research broadly lies in **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. At CMU’s **Robotics Institute**, I am currently exploring **zero-shot coordination** in cooperative MARL settings, with a focus on **offline-to-online frameworks** for efficient training and adaptation. In parallel, I am investigating **competitive MARL**, studying **targeted deception in zero-sum games** through **higher-order opponent modeling** and analysis of **historical response patterns** to exploit individual vulnerabilities while maintaining robustness.

Before CMU, I was a **Pre-doctoral Research Fellow** at **TCS Research**, advised by **Dr. Brojeshwar Bhowmick**, where I worked on **Task Planning for Indoor Object Rearrangement** under **partial observability (POMDP)**. My research involved building **graph-based scene representations** for scalable state understanding, employing **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for semantic object search, and integrating **Deep Reinforcement Learning** for sample-efficient and robust planning across both single and multi-room environments.

I am deeply fascinated by how intelligent agents can **learn structured, transferable policies** that generalize across tasks, embodiments, and environments — moving toward **autonomous systems capable of learning and reasoning like humans**. Looking ahead, I aim to develop **generalist robot policies** that unify learning, reasoning, and control, advancing the design of adaptable embodied agents for diverse real-world tasks.

Outside of research, I’m a **chess enthusiast**, **squash and table tennis player**, and an unrepentant **coffee addict** who enjoys strategic thinking both on and off the board.

I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Katia Sycara.

My research explores multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and competitive environments, emphasizing belief modeling, opponent adaptation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Previously, I was a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow at TCS Research, India, working on task planning for indoor object rearrangement under partial observability.

I hold a B.Tech (Honors) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I received the Program Gold Medal for highest GPA.
