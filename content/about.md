## Professional Background

I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Katia Sycara.

My research explores multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and competitive environments, emphasizing belief modeling, opponent adaptation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Previously, I was a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow at TCS Research, India, working on task planning for indoor object rearrangement under partial observability.

I hold a B.Tech (Honors) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I received the Program Gold Medal for highest GPA.
