## About Me

## About Me

Hello! I’m **Karan Mirakhor**, a **second-year MSR student in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)**, advised by [**Prof. Katia Sycara**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/).

My research lies at the intersection of **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**, **belief modeling**, and **generalization in cooperative and competitive settings**.  
At CMU’s [**Robotics Institute**](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), I work on:

- 🧠 **Zero-shot coordination** in cooperative MARL  
  Developing agents that can seamlessly collaborate with previously unseen partners without additional training. Specifically, I focus on **offline-to-online training frameworks** that leverage behavioral diversity in offline datasets coupled with efficient online adaptation using belief models.

- 🎭 **Competitive MARL and targeted deception**  
  Designing **targeted deception strategies** by leveraging **higher-order opponent belief models** and analyzing **historical response patterns** to identify and exploit individual vulnerabilities.

### 🎓 Undergraduate Research

**B.Tech (Honors) in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** — [**IIIT Hyderabad**](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)  
*Research Assistant, [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/)*  
*Advisor: [Dr. Harikumar Kandath](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=5i1t_QgAAAAJ&hl=en)*  

- Worked on **aerial manipulator control** using **Control Barrier Lyapunov constraints** within a **Model Predictive Controller** for safe and stable operation.

### 🔭 Research Vision

I am deeply fascinated by how **intelligent agents** can learn **structured, transferable policies** that generalize across **tasks, embodiments, and environments** — moving towards autonomous systems capable of **learning and reasoning like humans**.  

My long-term goal is to develop **generalist robot policies** that **unify learning, reasoning, and control**, advancing adaptable embodied agents for diverse real-world tasks.

### ☕ Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I enjoy:
- ♟️ **Chess** – strategy and pattern recognition inspire my research outlook.  
- 🏸 **Squash** & 🏓 **Table Tennis** – my go-to balance for mind and movement.  
- ☕ **Coffee** – a daily ritual that fuels both thought and curiosity.
