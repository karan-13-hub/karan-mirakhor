    "content": "## About Me\n\nHello! I’m Karan Mirakhor, a second-year Master of Science (Research) student in Robotics (MSR) at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).\nGraduate Research Assistant - [Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/advanced-agent-robotics-technology-lab/)\nAdvisor: [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/)    \nMy research primarily focuses on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Specifically, my work is on:\n\n---\n\n🧠 Zero-shot Coordination in Cooperative MARL  \nDeveloping agents that can seamlessly collaborate with previously unseen partners without additional training.  \nSpecifically, I focus on offline-to-online training frameworks that leverage behavioral diversity in offline datasets and enable efficient online adaptation using belief models.\n\n🎭 Competitive MARL and Targeted Deception  \nDeveloping targeted deception strategies by leveraging higher-order opponent belief models and analyzing historical response patterns to identify and exploit individual behavioral vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Previous Research Experience\n\n📚 Pre-doctoral Research Fellow — [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation)  \nAdvisor: [Dr. Brojeshwar Bhowmick](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=Eqf8NrEAAAAJ&hl=en)  \n\nExplored Task Planning for Indoor Object Rearrangement under partial observability (POMDP). Developed scalable graph-based scene representations, utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic object search, and applied Deep RL for efficient single and multi-room planning.\n\n---\n\n🎓 B.Tech (Honors) in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) — [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)  \nResearch Assistant, [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/)  \nAdvisor: [Dr. Harikumar Kandath](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=5i1t_QgAAAAJ&hl=en)  \n\nWorked on aerial manipulator control using Control Barrier Lyapunov constraints within a Model Predictive Controller for safe and stable operation.\n\n---\n\n## 🔭 Future Vision\n\nI am fascinated by how intelligent agents can learn structured, transferable policies that generalize across tasks, embodiments, and environments, moving toward autonomous systems capable of learning and reasoning like humans.  \n\nMy long-term goal is to develop generalist robot policies that unify learning, reasoning, and control, advancing adaptable embodied agents for diverse real-world tasks.\n\n---\n\n## ☕ Beyond Research\n\nOutside the lab, I enjoy ♟️ Chess, 🏸 Squash, and 🏓 Table Tennis tennis. I’m a dedicated ☕ coffee enthusiast who enjoys strategy both on and off the board.\n\n---\n\n## Research Statistics\n\n- **Years Research Experience**: 5+\n- **Years Job Experience**: 2+\n- **Publications & Patents**: 3+"
