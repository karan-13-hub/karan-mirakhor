    title: "Belief-Guided Zero-Shot Coordination for Multi-Agent Systems",
    authors: "Karan Mirakhor, Katia Sycara",
    venue: "ICLR",
    year: 2026,
    link: "https://openreview.net/forum?id=jJvXNpvOdM",
    content: "We propose a novel approach to zero-shot coordination in multi-agent systems by leveraging belief modeling and opponent adaptation. Our method enables agents to coordinate effectively with unseen partners by maintaining beliefs about their strategies and adapting accordingly. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in cooperative environments with partial observability."

    title: "Strategic Deception in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    authors: "Karan Mirakhor, Katia Sycara, Prashant Doshi",
    venue: "AAMAS",
    year: 2025,
    link: "https://example.com/paper2",
    content: "This work explores the role of strategic deception in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments. We develop a framework for agents to learn when and how to deceive opponents while maintaining cooperation when beneficial. The approach shows improved performance in competitive scenarios with partial information."

    title: "Hierarchical Task Planning for Robotic Object Rearrangement under Partial Observability",
    authors: "Karan Mirakhor, TCS Research Team",
    venue: "ICRA",
    year: 2024,
    link: "https://example.com/paper3",
    content: "We present a hierarchical approach to task planning for robotic object rearrangement in partially observable environments. The method combines high-level symbolic planning with low-level motion planning, enabling robots to handle uncertainty and adapt to changing environments. Experimental results show improved success rates in cluttered indoor scenarios."
